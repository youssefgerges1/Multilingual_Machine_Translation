# Multilingual_Machine_Translation
This project focuses on developing machine translation models that translate multiple languages into English. We explored various architectures and approaches for this purpose, starting with encoder-decoder models with attention, experimenting with transformers from scratch, and finally leveraging a pretrained model for language detection and translation. The deployment of different models was carried out using **FastAPI** and **Streamlit**.

## **Approach and Methods**

1. **Custom Model Development:**
    - **Encoder-Decoder Architecture:**  
      We experimented with building custom models using encoder-decoder architectures.
    - **Attention Mechanism:**  
      We incorporated attention mechanisms to improve the model's ability to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence during translation.
    - **Languages:**  
      We focused on **Italian, Arabic, Japanese, and French** for our initial experiments.

2. **Transformer-Based Model:**
    - We developed a transformer-based model specifically for translating **Portuguese into English**. This required handling tokenization, positional encodings, and multi-head self-attention mechanisms manually.

3. **Pretrained Model (m2m100_418M):**  
 
    - For the final phase, we switched to the **facebook/m2m100_418M** pretrained model, which can handle **language detection and translation** across multiple languages.
    - **Language Detection:**  
      We utilized the pretrained **m2m100_418M** model to detect the source language of the input text.
    - **Translation:**  
      Once the language was identified, we employed the model to translate the text into **English**.
    - **Streamlit Deployment:**  
      We deployed this solution using **Streamlit** for a user-friendly web interface.

## Model Deployment

### FastAPI Deployment

- Used for the initial encoder-decoder and transformer models.  
- Lightweight APIs exposed endpoints for translation.  
- Supported input in **Italian, Arabic, Japanese, French, and Portuguese**.

### Streamlit Deployment

- Used for the **facebook/m2m100_418M** model.  
- Interactive web interface for users to input text in any language and view translations.  
- Language detection and translation handled automatically.

## Usage

1. **FastAPI**:
    - Run the FastAPI server using the `uvicorn` command.
    - Access the API via: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/translate`
    - Example Request:
        
        ```json
        {
          "text": "Ol√°, como vai?"
        }
        ```
        
2. **Streamlit**:
    - Run the Streamlit app with the command above.
    - Enter text in the input box, and the translation will appear along with detected language information.
